                        <p><b>Platform Purpose:</b>
                       In today‚Äôs digital age, many students find themselves distracted by 
                       mobile phones and entertainment, leaving their studies behind. To address 
                       this issue, I created DevSkillTracker‚Äîa skill-based video learning 
                       platform designed to turn idle screen time into productive learning time. 
                      By linking real-time scores to unique user IDs, students are encouraged to 
                      engage with educational content and develop their skills, making their screen
                       time meaningful and rewarding....

                        <br>
<p><b> Personal Story & Motivation:</b> 
    As someone who personally struggled with balancing screen time
     and studies, I recognized that this challenge is common among 
     many students today. The constant distraction of mobile phones 
     and social media made it difficult to stay focused on learning. 
     That‚Äôs when I realized the potential to turn screen time into 
     something valuable. Inspired by my own struggles, I developed 
     DevSkillTracker to not only help students focus on learning but 
     also reward their progress with real-world value. My goal was to 
     transform their learningjourney into an engaging, career-building experience....

                               <br>
                            <p>While the platform is in its initial stages, 
                                I envision expanding it to include live sessions,
                                 peer-to-peer challenges, and skill assessments. 
                                 These additions will make DevSkillTracker a
                                  comprehensive educational tool that continues 
                                  to engage students, helping them grow their
                                   skills and stay
                                 motivated on their learning journey.
